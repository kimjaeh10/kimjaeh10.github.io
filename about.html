				<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
				<div class="container-about">
					<p>My name is Jay Kim, and I will be completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Michigan State University in December 2020. I have worked on a variety of projects that have allowed me to put what I've learned in the classroom into use in a practical sense.</p>
					<p>I started coding from 10 years old and my first programming language was C++. Since I was very young at the time, I couldn't create a super fancy and beautiful application, but I found that programming is pretty fun. When I was in middle school, I developed macro applications in AutoHotKey and even made a few hundred dollars for pocket money.</p>
					<p>Then, I moved to the United States at the end of my freshman year in South Korea. During my senior year in high school, It was a great experience to learn more about Computer Science by taking AP Computer Science and AP Computer Science Principle, and I decided to major in Computer Science.</p>
					<p>Hence, I have prepared myself to accept the challenges in this ever challenging world and I will try my best effort to become the top software engineer.</p>
					<p>By the way, I'm eligible to work in the US, so no sponsorship for work authorization is needed.</p>
